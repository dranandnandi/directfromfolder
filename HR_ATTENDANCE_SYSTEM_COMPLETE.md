## üèóÔ∏è **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

### **Database Schema (Supabase)**
```sql
-- Core Tables Created:
- shifts (id, name, start_time, end_time, organization_id, buffer_minutes)
- employee_shifts (employee_id, shift_id, effective_from, effective_to)
- attendance (punch_in/out_time, location, selfie_url, is_late, is_early_out)
- attendance_regularizations (attendance_id, reason, status, approver_id)

-- Automated Features:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for organization isolation
- Triggers for automatic late/early detection
- Attendance calculation functions
```

### **Service Layer (TypeScript)**
```typescript
// AttendanceService.ts - Complete business logic
- Shift management (create, assign, get employee shifts)
- Punch in/out with geolocation & file upload
- Attendance calculations (hours worked, overtime)
- Regularization workflows (request, approve, reject)
- Organization-wide attendance reporting
```

### **UI Components (React)**
```tsx
// Admin Components:
- AttendanceDashboard.tsx (real-time monitoring, stats, regularizations)
- ShiftManagement.tsx (create shifts, assign employees)

// Employee Components:
- PunchInOut.tsx (camera access, location tracking, attendance status)
```
